                        <p>
                            This project was born from a personal issue that kept coming up very frequently. I spent
                            some time as a rideshare delivery driver, and found it very hard to track what kind of money
                            I could expect to make on any given day. Swurf Savings is a saving and earnings tracker tool
                            made specifically for rideshare drivers. It takes into account a drivers' shifts, and how
                            much they would earn depending on how they would schedule their work times.
